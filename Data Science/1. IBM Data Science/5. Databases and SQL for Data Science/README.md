<h1>Week 1 - Introduction to Databases and Basic SQL</h1>



<h2>Introduction to Databases</h2>

__SQL__ is a language used for relational databases to query or get data out of a database. SQL is short for its original name __Structured Query Language__. SQL is a language used for a database to query data.

__Data__ is a collection of facts in the form of words, numbers or even pictures. Data is one of the most critical assets of any business. Data is important, so it needs to be secure and it needs to be stored and accessed quickly. The answer is a database.

A __Database__ is a repository of data. It is a program that stores data. A database also provides the functionality for adding, modifying and querying that data. There are different kinds of databases of different requirements.

The data can be stored in various forms. When data is stored in tabular form, the data is organized in tables like in a spreadsheet, it is a __relational database__. A table is a collection of related things like a list of employees or a list of book authors. In a relational database, you can form relationships between tables.

A set of software tools for the data in the database is called a __database management system__ or __DBMS__ for short. For relational databases, it's called a _relational database management system_ or _RDBMS_. RDBMS is a set of software tools that controls the data such as access, organization and storage. Examples of relational database management systems are, my SQL, Oracle Database, DB2 Warehouse on Cloud and DB2 Express C.

There are five simple SQL commands:
- __CREATE__ a table,
- __INSERT__ data to populate the table,
- __SELECT__ data from the table,
- __UPDATE__ data in the table,
- __DELETE__ data from the table.
