<h1>Week 1: Defining Data Science and What Data Scientists Do</h1>


<h2>Defining Data Science</h2>

<h3>What is Data Science?</h3>

Data Science is a process, not an event. It is the process of using data to understand different things, to understand the world. For me is when you have a model or hypothesis of a problem, and you try to validate that hypothesis or model with your data. Data science is the art of uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind data. It's when you translate data into a story. So use storytelling to generate insight. And with these insights, you can make strategic choices for a company or an institution. Data science is a field about processes and systems to extract data from various forms of whether it is unstructured or structured form. Data science is the study of data. Like biological sciences is a study of biology, physical sciences, it's the study of physical reactions. Data is real, data has real properties, and we need to study them if we're going to work on them.

<h3>The Many Paths to Data Science</h3>

Data science didn't really exist when I was growing up. It's not something that I ever woke up and said, I want to be a data scientist when I grow up. This is not just my case, if you talk to enough data scientists you will see that they come from all kinds of fields, I have a degree in Electrical Engineering in Physics, I have taught students with backgrounds from Business to Arts and they all dabble into data science at one point or the other. It can be when you are trying to solve some problem, looking into data science to apply in your field or looking to completely change your field, it doesn't matter what your background is, all you need is passion for continuous learning of new tools and patience to clean and analyze data.

<h3>Advice for New Data Scientists</h3>

My advice to an aspiring data scientist is to be curious, extremely argumentative and judgmental. Curiosity is absolute must. If you're not curious, you would not know what to do with the data. Judgmental because if you do not have preconceived notions about things you wouldn't know where to begin with. Argumentative because if you can argument and if you can plead a case, at least you can start somewhere and then you learn from data and then you modify your assumptions and hypotheses and your data would help you learn. And you might start at the wrong point. You may say that I thought I believed this, but now with data I know this. So, this allows you a learning process. So, curiosity being able to take a position, strong position, and then moving forward with it. The other thing that the data scientist would need is some comfort and flexibility with analytics platforms: some software, some computing platform, but that's secondary. The most important thing is curiosity and the ability to take positions. Once you have done that, once you've analyzed, then you've got some answers. And that's the last thing that a data scientist need, and that is the ability to tell a story. That once you have your analytics, once you have your tabulations, now you should be able to tell a great story from it. Because if you don't tell a great story from it, your findings will remain hidden, remain buried, nobody would know. But your rise to prominence is pretty much relying on your ability to tell great stories. A starting point would be to see what is your competitive advantage. Do you want to be a data scientist in any field or a specific field? Because, let's say you want to be a data scientist and work for an IT firm or a web-based or Internet based firm, then you need a different set of skills. And if you want to be a data scientist in the health industry, then you need different sets of skills. So figure out first what you're interested, and what is your competitive advantage. Your competitive advantage is not necessarily going to be your analytical skills. Your competitive advantage is your understanding of some aspect of life where you exceed beyond others in understanding that. Maybe it's film, maybe it's retail, maybe it's health, maybe it's computers. Once you've figured out where your expertise lies, then you start acquiring analytical skills. What platforms to learn and those platforms, those tools would be specific to the industry that you're interested in. And then once you have got some proficiency in the tools, the next thing would be to apply your skills to real problems, and then tell the rest of the world what you can do with it.

<h3>Data Science Topics and Algorithms</h3>

I really enjoy regression I'd say regression was maybe one of the first concepts that I that really helped me understand data so I enjoy a regression. Let me explain regression in the simplest possible terms. If you have ever taken a cab ride a taxi ride you understand regression. Here's how it works. The moment you sit in a cab ride in a cab you see that there's a fixed amount there it's is 2.50 you rather the cab moves or you get off this is what you owe to the driver the moment you step into a cab that's a constant you have to pay that amount if you have stepped into a cab. Then as it starts moving for every meter or hundred meters the fare increases by certain amount so there's a there's a fraction there's a relationship between distance and the amount you would pay above and beyond that constant. And if you're not moving and you're stuck in traffic then every additional minute you have to pay more so as the minutes increase your fare increases as the distance increases your fare increases and while all this is happening you've already paid a base fare which is the constant this is what regression is regression tells you what the base fare is and what is the relationship between time and the fare you have paid and the distance you have traveled and the fear you've paid because in the absence of knowing those relationships and just knowing how much people traveled for and how much they paid regression allows you to compute that constant that you didn't know it was 2.50 and it would compute the relationship between the fare and and the distance and the fare and the time. That is regression.

<h3>What is the cloud?</h3>

Cloud is a godsend for data scientists primarily because you take your data, take your information, and put it in the Cloud, put it in the central storage system. It allows you to bypass the physical limitations of the computers and the systems you're using, and it allows you to deploy the analytics and storage capacities of advanced machines that do not necessarily have to be your machine or your company's machine. Cloud allows you not just to store large amounts of data on servers somewhere in California or in Nevada, but it also allows you to deploy very advanced computing algorithms and the ability to do high performance computing using machines that are not yours. So, think of it as you have some information, you can't store it, so you send it to storage space, let's call it Cloud. And the algorithms that you need to use, you don't have them with you. But then, on the Cloud, you have those algorithms available. So, what you do is you deploy those algorithms on very large data sets and you're able to do it even though your own systems, your own machines, your own computing environment would not allow you to do so. So, Cloud is beautiful. And the other thing Cloud is beautiful for is that it allows multiple entities to work with same data at the same time. So, you can be working with the same data that your colleagues in, say, Germany, and another team in India, and another team in Ghana, they are collectively working and they're able to do so because the information, and the algorithms, and the tools, and the answers, and the results, whatever they needed is available at a central place which we call Cloud.

<h2>Big Data and Data Mining</h2>

<h3>Data Science Skills & Big Data</h3>

My definition of big data is data that is large enough and has enough volume and velocity that you cannot handle it with traditional database systems. Some of our statisticians think big data is something you can't fit on a thumb drive. Big data, to me, was started by Google. When Google tried to figure out how they were, when Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to, basically, figure out how to solve their page rank algorithm, there was nothing out there. They were trying to store all of the web pages in the world, and there was no technology, there was no way to do this, and so they went out and developed this approach, which has now become, Hadoop has copied it, but this is where all these large, big data clusters are found. But big data has now also expanded into, how do you analyze? There are new analytical techniques and statistical techniques for handling these really, really, really large data sets.

<h3>What is Hadoop?</h3>

Traditionally in computation and processing data we would bring the data to the computer. You'd wanna program and you'd bring the data into the program. In a big data cluster what Larry Page and Sergey Brin came up with is very simple is they took the data and they sliced it into pieces and they distributed each and they replicated each piece or triplicated each piece and they would send it the pieces of these files to thousands of computers first it was hundreds but then now it's thousands now it's tens of thousands. And then they would send the same program to all these computers in the cluster. And each computer would run the program on its little piece of the file and send the results back. The results would then be sorted and those results would then be redistributed back to another process. The first process is called a map or a mapper process and the second one was called a reduce process. Fairly simple concepts but turned out that you could do lots and lots of different kinds of handle lots and lots of different kinds of problems and very, very, very large data sets. So the one thing that's nice about these big data clusters is they scale linearly. You had twice as many servers and you get twice the performance and you can handle twice the amount of data. So this was just broke a bottleneck for all the major social media companies. Yahoo then got on board. Yahoo hired someone named Doug Cutting who had been working on a clone or a copy of the Google big data architecture and now that's called Hadoop. And if you google Hadoop you'll see that it's now a very popular term and there are many, many, many if you look at the big data ecology there are hundreds of thousands of companies out there that have some kind of footprint in the big data world.
