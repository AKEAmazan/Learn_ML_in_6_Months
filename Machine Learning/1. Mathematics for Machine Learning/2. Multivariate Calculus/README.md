<h1>Week 1: What is calculus?</h1>



<h2>Functions</h2>

Essentially, a function is a relationship between some inputs and an output. So, for example, if I had a function for modeling the distribution of temperature in this room, I might input the x, y, and z coordinates of a specific location I'm interested in as well as the time, t. And then the function would return me the temperature at that specific point in space at that moment in time.

Calculus is just a set of tools for describing the relationship between a function and the change in its variables.
