<h1>Week 1: What is calculus?</h1>



<h2>Functions</h2>

Essentially, a function is a relationship between some inputs and an output. So, for example, if I had a function for modeling the distribution of temperature in this room, I might input the x, y, and z coordinates of a specific location I'm interested in as well as the time, t. And then the function would return me the temperature at that specific point in space at that moment in time.

<h3>Rise Over Run</h3>

Calculus is just a set of tools for describing the relationship between a function and the change in its variables.

<h2>Jacobians - vectors of derivatives</h2>


<h3>The Jacobian</h3>

In vector calculus, the __Jacobian matrix__ of a vector-valued function in several variables is the matrix of all its first-order partial derivatives. When this matrix is square, that is, when the function takes the same number of variables as input as the number of vector components of its output, both the matrix and its determinant are referred to as the __Jacobian__.

<h2>The Hessian</h2>

In mathematics, the __Hessian matrix__ or __Hessian__ is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function, or scalar field. It describes the local curvature of a function of many variables.
