<h1>Week 1: Agile Fundamentals</h1>



<h2>Introduction</h2>


<h3>What software development looks like?</h3>

Software Development Process in Waterfall Model:
1. Requirements: what exactly you need to build.
2. Design: what are the different components that we need to build and how they're going to work together.
3. Implementation: start coding and do unit tests, integration tests or card verification and functional testing
4. Verification: Do a User Acceptance Testing.
5. Operations and Maintenance: software in production, bug fixes, new features based on consumer requests.

Problems with such a model:
- very difficult to predict the requirements one year or two a year ahead.
- misinterpretation of requirements might go undetected till verification.
- integration issues between the different components.

As a solution different variants of the waterfall model evolved:
- V Model which focuses a lot on testing.
- Sashimi Model or RUP Model that focuses a lot on overlapping different phases.
- Incremental model where you do the requirements in one shot but then you do the design, testing, and deployment in increments.
- Spiral Model which is a very risk driven approach.

The cons of the waterfall method also led to the evolution of the __Agile__ mindset and models like Scrum and Kanban and XP that helped implement this mindset. The basic idea behind all of this model was that instead of building this whole one year cycle, you build in short cycles adopting to the changes of the market and the user needs.

Due to this, the idea of _continuous integration_ and _automated testing and deployment_ was born.

<h3>Intro to Software Development Models</h3>

Classification of different models falls into two main categories:

- _Predictive_ vs _Adaptive_:
    - predictive: good understanding of the requirements so you build the product in one shot.
    - adaptive: general understanding of the requirements so you start with Proof of Concepts and small versions and use user feedback to iterate and implement the next version of the product.

- _Incremental_ vs _Iterative_:
    - incremental: good idea of the requirements but you build the product in increments, you break the product into smaller pieces.
    - iterative: general understanding of the requirements so you build the product iteratively and you replace your previous iteration with the newer ones with enhancements.


<h2>Agile Values and Principles</h2>


<h3>Why Agile?</h3>

The problem with the waterfall model was not that requirement translation issues were found, or the requirements were incorrect, it was the time we were finding these issues. Due to the cost of change, the later we find the problem, the more costly it's going to be. So the foundation of the Agile mindset was to try to reduce the learning cycle and to keep the cost of change down. Agile principles made the industry realize that software development is a creative process, and we need adaptive methods to be successful at it.

<h3>Agile Manifesto: Values</h3>

1. __Individuals and Interactions__ over Processes and Tools.

2. __Working Software__ over Comprehensive Documentation.

3. __Customer Collaboration__ over Contract Negotiation.

4. __Responding to Change__ over Following a plan.

<h3>Agile Manifesto: Principles</h3>

1. Our highest priority is to _satisfy the customer_ through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. _Welcome changing requirements_, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

3. _Deliver working software frequently_, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must _work together daily_ throughout the project.

5. Build _projects around motivated individuals_. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is _face-to-face conversation_.

7. _Working software_ is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote _sustainable development_. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous _attention to technical excellence and good design_ enhances agility.

10. _Simplicity_–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from _self-organizing teams_.

12. At regular intervals, the _team reflects_ on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

<h3>Agile: When to Use and When NOT to!</h3>

- Can be useful for small, medium and large scale projects.
- Can be useful for mission critical projects like government projects.
- Not suitable for predictive and repeatable work.
- Pre-requisites should be met:
    - Customer collaboration
    - The team should be set up for change by following engineering principles.

<h3>Agile Frameworks</h3>

- Scrum: based on one to four week cycle, where you take part of your project and you define, develop,  design and test your software. Your product is developed incrementally.

- Kanban: based on a continuous flow model where you basically try to optimize your existing software development process.

- Scrumban: Combination of Scrum and Kanban.

- XP: has most of the practices of the Scrum but it also defines some additional engineering practices.

- Lean Startup: helps you if you have a lot of unpredictable market or industry.
