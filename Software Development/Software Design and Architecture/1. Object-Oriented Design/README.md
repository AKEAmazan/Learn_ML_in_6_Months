<h2>Introduction to Software Design and Architecture</h2>

So, what is software design and architecture? How does it improve your software products? Consider this scenario. You join a project that's been in development for a while. You look at the code and become instantly overwhelmed. You can't tell what the purpose of the pieces are, things are unorganized, and design documentation is non-existent. You don't even know where to begin. These are all signs that the project was not well-designed from the outset. Or let's say that you are now working on a personal development project. When you began, you weren't quite sure what the functionalities would be, but you just started coding. It didn't matter that the code was unorganized because you were the only one working on it and you know how it works. You come up with a great new feature for your product, but in implementing it, you broke the program elsewhere. You should have designed it right. I'm guessing that you have experienced scenarios like these. They are quite common in the software industry, which shows you why software design and architecture is so beneficial.

<h3>Software Architect and Design</h3>

Typically, the software designer role would be responsible for outlining a software solution to a specific problem by designing the details of individual components and their responsibilities. A software architect role would be responsible for looking at the entire system and choosing appropriate frameworks, data storage, solutions and determining how components interact with each other. That brings us to the primary difference between software design and software architecture. In short, software design looks at the lower level aspects of a system, whereas software architecture tends to look at the bigger picture, the higher level aspects of a system. Think of this like designing a building. An architect focuses on the major structures and services, while an interior designer focuses on the smaller spaces within.
