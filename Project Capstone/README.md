<h1>Project Ideation</h1>

- Einstein Chatbot that is trained on his theories or personal life and answer questions about famous Physicists.

- Anomaly detection for planets or stars.

- Complete control system for your home, electricity through regular means and green energy from solar and wind and you use this data to predict usage and then build an optimum system that regulates your bills, should be able to add new devices to the system and the model should be able to accommodate. It will be like a phone app where the usage and all other details are shown along with how much you are saving. Can be like the 1st step in a connected home which will monitor your usage and makes suggestions or switches things off. I could try to build a model home to demo.
